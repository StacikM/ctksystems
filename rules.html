  <div class="card">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to CTK! These Terms of Service ("Terms") explain the rules and conditions under which you may use CTK projects and services. By using any CTK project, you agree to these Terms.</p>

      <strong>CTK</strong> = The CTK service, community, and its related systems.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>Section A: Rules</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Project Integrity:</strong> Do not recreate, clone, or remake any CTK projects without explicit permission. This includes “old remakes.”<br><em>PUNISHMENT:</em> Permanent CTK Blacklist and potential DMCA action if content is directly copied.</li>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>Section B: Punishments</h2>

      <li><strong>Temporary Suspension:</strong> Loss of access to CTK projects (excluding partner services) for up to one year.</li>
      <li><strong>CTK Blacklist:</strong> Permanent loss of access to all CTK projects, including partner projects. Blacklists are generally final and rarely lifted.</li>

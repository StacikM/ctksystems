  <h1>CTK Terms of Service</h1>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to CTK! These Terms of Service ("Terms") explain the rules and conditions under which you may use CTK projects and services. By using any CTK project, you agree to these Terms.</p>

      <strong>CTK</strong> = The CTK service, community, and its related systems.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>Section A: Rules</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Project Integrity:</strong> Do not recreate, clone, or remake any CTK projects without explicit permission. This includes “old remakes.”<br><em>PUNISHMENT:</em> Permanent CTK Blacklist and potential DMCA action if content is directly copied.</li>

      <li><strong>Respect and Conduct:</strong> CTK promotes a respectful and inclusive environment. Racism, sexism, harassment, or any form of hate speech is strictly prohibited.<br><em>PUNISHMENT:</em> See Section B (Normal Punishment Scheme).</li>

      <li><strong>Support System Usage:</strong> Use the support system properly and only for legitimate requests. Abuse or spamming is not tolerated.<br><em>PUNISHMENT:</em> IP ban from support services.</li>

      <li><strong>Unauthorized Access:</strong> Attempting to gain unauthorized access to CTK servers or data is strictly forbidden. Our systems automatically IP ban security threats.<br><em>PUNISHMENT:</em> CTK Blacklist and/or police report.</li>

      <li><strong>Exploiting Loopholes:</strong> Intentionally exploiting loopholes or technicalities to bypass these Terms will result in the same level of punishment as the intended violation.<br><em>PUNISHMENT:</em> As applicable per violation.</li>

  </div>

  <div class="card">
    <h2>Section B: Punishments</h2>

      <li><strong>Feature Restriction:</strong> Specific features may be removed (e.g., disabling certain bot commands) if they were used in a violation.</li>
      <li><strong>Temporary Suspension:</strong> Loss of access to CTK projects (excluding partner services) for up to one year.</li>
      <li><strong>CTK Blacklist:</strong> Permanent loss of access to all CTK projects, including partner projects. Blacklists are generally final and rarely lifted.</li>

  <ol>
    <li>

    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Intentional Project Damage:</strong>

      <em>PUNISHMENT:</em> Permanent CTK Blacklist and possible civil or criminal action.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Accountability & Reporting:</strong>

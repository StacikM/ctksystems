<h1>CTK Developer Policies</h1>

<div class="card">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    These Developer Policies ("Policies") govern how CTK SDKs, libraries, APIs, and developer tools may be used.
    By integrating, distributing, or executing any CTK-provided code, you agree to comply with these Policies.
  </p>

  <p><strong>DEFINITIONS:</strong><br>
    <strong>CTK SDK / Libraries</strong> = Any official CTK-distributed code, binaries, APIs, or tooling.<br>
    <strong>Developer Content</strong> = Any application, service, or project that uses CTK SDKs or libraries.<br>
    <strong>Enforcement Code</strong> = Logic executed by CTK systems that restricts or disables access based on policy violations.<br>
    <strong>CTK Blacklist</strong> = A permanent or temporary restriction applied to users, accounts, IPs, or environments.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h2>Section A: Acceptable SDK & Library Usage</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Authorized Use Only:</strong>
      CTK SDKs and libraries may only be used in accordance with their documented purpose. Reverse engineering,
      deobfuscation, or bypassing built-in safeguards is prohibited.<br>
      <em>ENFORCEMENT:</em> Immediate revocation of SDK access and CTK Blacklist.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>No Repackaging or Redistribution:</strong>
      You may not repackage, resell, sublicense, or redistribute CTK SDKs or libraries without explicit written authorization.<br>
      <em>ENFORCEMENT:</em> Permanent CTK Blacklist and potential legal action.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Content Responsibility:</strong>
      Developers are solely responsible for the content and behavior of applications built using CTK tools.
      CTK may restrict or disable SDK functionality if used to distribute harmful, abusive, or illegal content.<br>
      <em>ENFORCEMENT:</em> Feature restriction or full SDK disablement.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Security & Integrity:</strong>
      Attempts to interfere with CTK infrastructure, authentication systems, telemetry, or enforcement mechanisms
      are strictly prohibited.<br>
      <em>ENFORCEMENT:</em> Automatic enforcement triggers, IP blocking, and CTK Blacklist.
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h2>Section B: Blacklisting & Runtime Enforcement</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Execution-Level Restrictions:</strong>
      CTK reserves the right to execute server-side or client-side enforcement code that may limit,
      disable, or fully block functionality for blacklisted users or environments.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>No Circumvention:</strong>
      Any attempt to bypass CTK enforcement logic, blacklist checks, license validation,
      or access controls will be treated as a severe violation.<br>
      <em>ENFORCEMENT:</em> Permanent CTK Blacklist.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Propagation of Restrictions:</strong>
      Blacklist status may apply across all CTK services, SDKs, libraries, and partner integrations.
      Enforcement may occur automatically without prior notice.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Finality:</strong>
      Blacklist decisions are generally final. CTK is not obligated to provide appeals,
      explanations, or reinstatement.
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h2>Section C: Developer & Administrative Misconduct</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Abuse of Privileged Access:</strong>
      Developers or administrators with elevated access may not misuse credentials,
      keys, or permissions to alter CTK systems or harm other developers.<br>
      <em>ENFORCEMENT:</em> Immediate access revocation, CTK Blacklist, and potential legal action.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Intentional System Damage:</strong>
      Any deliberate attempt to disrupt, degrade, or destroy CTK services or SDK functionality
      will be treated as a critical violation.<br>
      <em>ENFORCEMENT:</em> Permanent CTK Blacklist and possible civil or criminal escalation.
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h2>Section D: Telemetry, Monitoring & Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    CTK SDKs may collect limited telemetry required for security, enforcement, and stability purposes.
    Use of CTK tools constitutes consent to this monitoring as outlined in our Privacy Policy.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h2>Section E: Policy Updates</h2>
  <p>
    CTK may update these Developer Policies at any time. Continued use of CTK SDKs or libraries
    after an update constitutes acceptance of the revised Policies.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Build responsibly. Abuse nothing.</h2>

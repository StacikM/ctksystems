        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>A1: CTK is an international helping system for your Discord server. We may sell some products like donations, but for now, everything is free!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">

        </div>

        <h2>Important Answers:</h2>

        <div class="question">
            <strong>Q1:</strong> Why did a CTK bot DM me/or a member about being banned from some features of CTK?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>A1: If you or your member violates our Terms of Services (<a href="https://ctksystem.com/rules">https://ctksystem.com/rules</a>), we will have to penalize him by terminating some features. In an emergency, we can ban someone if they are abusing CTK's services.</p>
            <p>A2: CTK can remove features from a member and notify the member with a DM, stating the features that have been removed and why, along with who to contact for appeals or questions. The server owner can't undo these punishments until they contact CTK.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
            <strong>Q2:</strong> Do CTK admins have admin commands on my server?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>A1: In some cases yes, and in some cases no. CTK admins have access to all bot commands provided by CTK, even those meant for your mods. However, CTK admins do not have administrator permission on your server to change anything.</p>

        <h2>Important answers:</h2>

        <div class="question">
            <strong>Q1:</strong> Why did a CTK bot DM me/or a member about being banned from some features of CTK?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>A1: If you or your member violates our Terms of services (https://ctksystem.com/rules), we will have to penalize him from your server in terminating some features. In a emergency, we can ban someone if they are abusing CTK's services.</p>
            <br>
            <p>A2: CTK can remove features  from a member and notifying the member with a DM saying the features that have been removed and why and who to contact to appeal or for questions. The server owner can't sadly undo these punishments until they contact CTK.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="question">
            <strong>Q2:</strong> Does CTK admins have admin commands on my server?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>A1: In some point yes and in some point no, CTK admins have access to all bot commands provided by CTK even that are for your mods. CTK admins do not have administrator permission on your server to change anything.</p>
